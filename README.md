1.  Work with IntelliJ IDEA and GitHub

2.  Perform simple mathematical calculations and output results

3.  Use the Scanner object for user input


Write a program to convert a Fahrenheit temperature to Celsius. 
The conversion formula is given below. You must convert the algebraic formula into valid Java syntax. 

C = $\frac{5}{9}$ (F - 32)

Sample Input/Output (User input is in bold)

<pre>
 *** Temperature Converter ***

 Enter a non-negative Fahrenheit temperature: <b>212.0</b>
 
 212 Fahrenheit is 100 Celsius

**To complete this assignment you must submit the following:**

1.  **An electronic Solution of your program on GitHub**

    a.  You are to click on the Lab03a Link on the Course Schedule. Once accepted, code up a
        complete solution to the above assignment specification. Your
        complete solution is to be pushed to GitHub.

    b.  Pay attention to the example output above. Your program's output
        must look **exactly** like the example output! The spacing and
        newlines in your output must match exactly.

    c.  Make sure that your program compiles and runs correctly with no
        errors and no warnings. If you get any errors, double check that
        you typed everything correctly. Be aware that Java is
        case-sensitive.

2.  **An electronic pdf (punetidLab03aTemperature.pdf) of your program is to be emailed to ryandj@pacificu.edu**
